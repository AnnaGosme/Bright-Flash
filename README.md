# Bright-Flash

The contributions of women to the advancement of science, the improvement of society and the care of our communities have always been there. Too often they are forgotten or overlooked in history books. The statement may be silent, but the effect is loud: our children are still being raised with an internalised conviction that men can achieve more than women.

The goal of this website is to give women back their rightful place in history. We have selected just a few amongst many pioneers, and would love to receive contributions to grow our list. By playing a game of memory cards, we hope that you will learn about and remember the names and contributions of these pioneering women.


> This project was created in React with the goal of using an API. Because there were no APIs of women who made history, we created one ourselves. You can take a look at it [here](https://github.com/AlessandraPettinato/Back-end-bright-flash). The deployed version of Bright Flash, instead, can be found [here](https://github.com/AlessandraPettinato/Front-end-bright-flash).
